# generic\_topo\_gen
Generic Topology Generator

This tool takes number of nodes and number of links;
Then generates random toplogies 
(which are strongly connected).
The number of random topologies is specified by the user.
This tool also supports regular topologies for example: _Mesh_, _Torus_, _FlattenedButterfly_.

Check `sample_commandlines.txt` to run the tool under different configurations 

## TODOs:
* Add optimizer support for generating topologies based on the traffic pattern _(in progress)_
* Python visualizer, which reads connectivity matrix (aka adjacency matrix) and shows the random topology generated with directed connections) _(in progress)_
* Add support for more well know topologies, for example _DragonFly_, _MegaFly_, _SlimFly_	[ Support needed ] 
* Optimize code for larger size topologies say 10k nodes or more
* ...

----
Suggestions are welcome!
